# CowDefenders - Tower Defense Game

**CowDefenders** is a strategic tower defense game made in pygame where **cows** battle against waves of **slimes**! Inspired by traditional tower defense mechanics and games like **Teamfight Tactics (TFT)**, players must strategically buy, combine, and place different cows to defend their farm from relentless slime invaders.

## Features

- **Cows vs. Slimes**: Defend your farm by assembling a powerful army of cows. Use their unique abilities to hold off waves of dangerous slimes.
- **TFT-Inspired Mechanics**: Just like in TFT, the game features a **shop** where players can buy cows (cards), refresh the shop, and combine cows of the same type to create stronger units.
- **Combining Cows**: Purchase three of the same cow, and you can **combine** them to create a more powerful version of that cow with enhanced abilities.
- **Multiple Waves**: Defend your farm through multiple waves of slimes, each becoming increasingly difficult. Survive until the last wave, or fight until your cows are overrun!
- **Dynamic Strategy**: Adjust your strategy between waves by buying new cows, upgrading existing ones, and positioning your cows on the map to counter the incoming slimes.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: You will begin with a limited amount of resources to buy cows from the **shop**.
2. **Buy Cows**: Each round, you'll have a set of random cows available for purchase. Use your resources wisely to buy cows and refresh the shop if necessary.
3. **Combine Cows**: Acquire three of the same cow to automatically combine them into a stronger unit.
4. **Position Your Cows**: After purchasing cows, drag and position them strategically on the battlefield to defend against the waves of slimes.
5. **Defend**: Slimes will attack in waves. Each cow you place will fight the slimes using their unique abilities. If you successfully defeat a wave, you can move on to the next.
6. **Repeat**: After each wave, you'll return to the shop to buy new cows, combine them, and prepare for the next attack.
7. **Victory or Defeat**: Survive until the final wave to win the game. If the slimes reach your farm's defenses and overwhelm you, the game is lost!

## Game Mechanics

- **Shop**: You can spend resources to buy new cows from the shop. The shop refreshes each round, or you can pay to refresh it manually.
- **Combining Cows**: When you purchase three identical cows, they automatically combine into a stronger version with better stats and abilities.
- **Upgrade Shop**: As you progress, you can upgrade the shop to offer more powerful and rare cows.
- **Wave System**: Each wave of slimes grows stronger. Youâ€™ll need to improve your cow army and strategy to deal with each new challenge.

## Cow Types

- **Moochine Gunner**: A rapid-fire cow with machine gun-like milk blasts. High attack speed but lower individual damage, great for taking down waves of small, fast-moving slimes.
  
- **Cowtapult**: A long-range cow that hurls large clumps of dirt at enemies, dealing area-of-effect (AoE) damage. Slower attack speed but deals heavy damage in a wide area.

- **Milker**: A support cow that heals other nearby cows over time. Great for keeping your defenses strong during long waves.

- **Steak Shield**: A defensive cow that creates a shield for itself and nearby cows, temporarily reducing incoming damage. Ideal for holding off waves of tough enemies.

- **Frost Cow**: Slows down enemies with each attack, covering them in a layer of frost that reduces their movement speed, allowing your other cows to finish them off more easily.


Combine cows to unlock even stronger versions with upgraded abilities!
